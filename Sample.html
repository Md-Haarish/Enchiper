    <h2>Why do I want to learn HTML.</h2>
    <p>HTML is your gateway into the world of web development—it’s the language that turns ideas into real, clickable web pages. With just a few simple tags, you can structure content, shape layouts, and bring your creativity to life on the internet. It’s beginner-friendly, powerful, and the first step toward mastering CSS, JavaScript, and modern web frameworks. In short, learning HTML lets you build the web instead of just browsing it.</p>
